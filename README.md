## Machine Learning Columbia


This repository contains the weekly projects of the ColumbiaX University Machine Learning Certification Program - CSMM.102x offered by edx.org.

-----

#### Regression

The first project consists of two parts: The first one is to calculate the weights of a ridge regression. And the second is the implementation of an Active Learning process.


#### Classification

In this assignment, you will implement a K-class Bayes classifier.


#### Clustering

In this assignment you will implement the K-means and EM Gaussian mixture models.


### PMF

In this assignment you will implement the probabilistic matrix factorization (PMF) model.
